# My-Linux-Setup
Setting up Debian Linux desktop with KDE. Not really much, just what I'll usually install. If you have any reccomendations or something feel free to suggest a change. 

            git clone https://github.com/AlsoAHuman/My-Linux-Setup
            cd My-Linux-Setup
            sudo bash ./setup.bash
